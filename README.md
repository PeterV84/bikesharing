The first part of the dataset to explore a very general overview of what the Bike riders look like from a Riding and mapping perspective so we can get a good idea of where the bike riding population tends to favor.

Here we can see that the Bike riders are most prevelant in upper Manhattan, just near central park. This is where the Bikes are generally first picked and and the main starting point for these riders.

The next point we can see is that most of the Bike riders are avoiding long trips and doing five to ten minute intervals.

We can make many assumptions about this, but long term this could mean the bikes are mainly for short distance transportation, maybe for locations where a taxi or walking isnt ideal.

Our next step is to find our demographic. From our next line graph we can see that our primary riders are males.

We can utilize this information to solidify our base audience in the short term while testing different avenues to expand our demographic further.

Now we should look at the frequency of bike riders during a daily timeframe.

From this heat chart we can possibly assume that these bike riders are using the bikes to get to and from work. 

Now we should see what breakdown of our bike riders are using during certain times. 

<img width="831" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 5 20 09 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100393032/180338389-7ae331a1-92b3-4408-8c2d-5e66964797a4.png">

We can see that the riding times between the genders is basically the same, which means these bikes are probably utilized mainly for work, at least on the weekdays.

Now we should look at how many of these riders are casual customers or subscribers and what gender they fall into.

<img width="711" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 5 21 58 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100393032/180338572-25907ec0-54b1-4138-b041-be0da472c50b.png">

What is a common theme is the male demographic being the highest user of the bike service and the highest subscribers. The casual bike rider seems to prefer Saturdays as their riding days.

As preparations for the service includes not just the riders but also the regular maintenance of the bikes. 

<img width="841" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 5 22 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100393032/180338862-c5685b1a-a476-4fd7-b637-3a3467742fea.png">

If we click and view this data we see that the bikes that are ridden over 200 hundred times began to start needing repairs.

Our final chart is where the bikes end up after riding. 

<img width="345" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 5 23 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100393032/180340725-2f77f613-e567-40f0-93d6-f917a009a852.png">

It shouldnt come as a suprise that with most of the bike riders taking rides no longer than ten minutes, that most of the bikes stay around the same area. 

### Summary: 

From this analysis we can make a business model that begins with marketing towards 9-5 male workers. This biking venture should start primarily in urban areas as this is the most likely area to get riders. From there we can asses biking repairs, the number of riders, and cater to a larger demographic in order to expand the biking opportunity.
